         -not- equispaced) time levels.  In current form, this function
         supports up to four time levels (times[-2]->times[1]) */

      /* Now, mathematically we are to approximate:
            u_t(t) = u_expl(t) + u_impl(t)
         where u_expl and u_impl are terms to be stepped implicitly and
         explicitly, respectively.  It's also "nice" to require u_impl
         be evaluated at only one timelevel (t[1]), since that reduces
         the amount of data we have to keep around.  Thus, the skeleton
         looks like:
            A*u(t[-2]) + B*u(t[-1]) + C*u(t[0]) + D*u(t[1]) =
               E*u_ex(t[-2]) + F*u_ex(t[-1]) + G*u_ex(t[0]) +
               u_impl(t[1])

         Our first task is to find A/B/C/D consistently with u_impl(t[1]).
         Formally, the job is to build the Taylor series corresponding to
         u(t[-2..1]), differentiate, and cancel (4) terms.  This is annoying.

         The Taylor expansion essentially creates a polynomial in (t-t[k]).
         Another, easier way to create this same polynomial is to use an
         interpolating form: the Lagrange interpolating polynomial.  Taking
         the derivative of this (at t=t[1]) will give the A..D coefficients
         immediately. */
